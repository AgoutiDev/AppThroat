# AppThroat
Just a light modification

(This repository is the initial layout for the job ...)

Establish: https://github.com/Phuks-co/throat

1. Replace the files in the `app` folder
2. `npm run build`
3. You can run a test server by executing `./throat.py`

Just for reference, working layout ...

* Changed svg icons
* Some minor changes.


There is a lot of work to be done on sisebar (as there is a lot of "noise" now).
